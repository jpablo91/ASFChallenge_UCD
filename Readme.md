Hi everyone!  
  We can use this repo to share the code and materials we will be using for the challenge.  
  I could not upload one of the files from the mock data (Landcover) the people from the challange provided, you can download the data from the website or using this [LINK](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/c3smpi8zby3qgg70scl5uyq1swl9kxag) to a Box shared folder.
  
  I had a quick look at the data and checked the spatial distribution of the vaiables, you can find it [Here](Code/DataExplortion.md)
