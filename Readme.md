Hi everyone!  
  We can use this repo to share the code and materials we will be using for the challenge.  
  If you want to read more about the challenge here is the [LINK](https://www6.inrae.fr/asfchallenge/). In the next meeting we can talk about some ideas and how are we organizing to work together.  
  I could not upload one of the files from the mock data (Landcover) the people from the challange provided, you can download the data from the website or using this [LINK](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/c3smpi8zby3qgg70scl5uyq1swl9kxag) to a Box shared folder. Nistara suggested me to use a sym link but I'm still figuring out how to do that 
  
  I had a quick look at the data and checked the spatial distribution of the vaiables, you can find it [Here](Code/DataExploration.md).
  
  I created a When is good poll so we can have our next meeting and talk about some initial ideas, you can answer your availability here: [Poll](http://whenisgood.net/2qi5h7s), the results will be shown [Here](http://whenisgood.net/2qi5h7s/results/34d2anj), in case we need to edit the event there is this [LINK](http://whenisgood.net/2qi5h7s/edit/34d2anj).
