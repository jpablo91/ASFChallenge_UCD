## Summary of the meeting
We talked about the code for the period 1, and how we can organize better the files and the data.  

#### Symlinking data folder from Box to our project
- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal
- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal
- Also, adding `Data*` to the `.gitignore` file ignores these symlinks
- Going forward we might want to do the same thing for the GAMA related data folders...

#### Parameter values
- Kathleen will help us determine which values to use and what makes sense wrt ASF

#### Plots for summarizing outputs.
- Pablo will provide the simulation outputs and Nistara will have a look at different approaches for a better visualization of the results.
